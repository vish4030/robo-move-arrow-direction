                    left side of the screen, locate the "motion"
                    category. You will find blocks like "Move 10steps"
                    "Turn 15 degree" and "Go to x:[] y:[]."

                    y; []" block into the scripting area. Set the x and Y
                    values of the block to the coordinates of the target
                    position you want the sprite to move to. For
                    example, if you want the sprite to move to position
                    (200,100), set the x value to 200 and the y value to 100.
